# google-homepage
Google homepage clone for **The Odin Project**'s [HTML/CSS project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

### **Easy Version:** Build the [Google.com](http://www.google.com/) homepage
(the simple one with just a search box).

#### Tips:

* DON’T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You’re just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn’t have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.
* [Here’s a link to the Google Logo just in case they temporarily replace it with a Doodle!](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)
* [Here’s a cached page of the Google home page for reference in case the original logo is not there](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/)

I based it on the cached page linked above. I didn't use flexbox or grid because I wanted to practice positioning without them
